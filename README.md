## About
This project is a prototype smart doorbell system made with an _Arduino Uno R3_ and various sensors from the _ELEGOO Most Complete Starter Kit_. This project is being made for a final project for one of my classes here at UVM.

## Setup
1. Setup circuit as shown in **INSERT LINK TO CIRCUIT DIAGRAM**
2. Download [BLE Serial tiny](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ble-serial-tiny/id1607862132)

> **_Optional:_** Run the code in **INSERT LINK TO FILE HERE**, following the comments to rename your HM-10 Bluetooth Device

## Project Requirements
