## About
This project is a prototype smart doorbell system made with an _Arduino Uno R3_ and various sensors from the _ELEGOO Most Complete Starter Kit_. This project is being made for a final project for one of my classes here at UVM.

## Setup
1. Setup circuit as shown in [schematic](https://github.com/owncook/Arduino-Doorbell/blob/main/schematic.png)
2. Download [BLE Serial tiny](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ble-serial-tiny/id1607862132)
3. When the circuit is connected, run the code in [get_rfid_id](https://github.com/owncook/Arduino-Doorbell/blob/main/get_rfid_id/get_rfid_id.ino) and copy and paste the tag ID into the acceptedTag variable on line 109 in [arduino_doorbell](https://github.com/owncook/Arduino-Doorbell/blob/7d867f3024a8e6fcdeb75cd9113df0d4b9efdf85/arduino_doorbell/arduino_doorbell.ino#L109)¬†

> **_Optional:_** Run the code in [rename_bluetooth](https://github.com/owncook/Arduino-Doorbell/blob/main/rename_bluetooth/rename_bluetooth.ino), following the comments to rename your HM-10 Bluetooth Device
